      <h2>üè† Real Estate</h2>

      <img src="img/appart.jpeg" alt="Julien" class="image-corps-gauche" />
      <p>I've always been passionate about real estate. That's why, with my twin brother, also a student at ESSEC Business School, we are launching our real estate agency this summer. It will be a 100% digital agency, based in Paris and specialised in luxury real estate. In order to make ourselves known, we will use a content strategy on social networks and on YouTube. We will also advertise online through our big brother's company, Digitalflow, which specialises in digital marketing and advertising.</p>

      <h2>üèí Sports</h2>
      <img src="img/hockey.jpg" alt="Julien" class="image-corps-droite" />
      <p>I am also a great sportsman. I have been playing roller hockey for more than 10 years, as you can see on the picture on the right. It is a sport that is very close to ice hockey. I play as a forward. In a few weeks, I will be in the Alps for the semi-finals of the French championship. In addition to roller hockey, I played basketball for a long time. Many memories with friends, many tournaments but also many titles.</p>
